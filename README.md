# Flickgo

This is a fork of the code.google.com hosted library (https://code.google.com/p/flickgo/) written originally by https://github.com/manki

This is a client library written in Google's Go language for interacting with Flickr's REST API. Primary development focus is to be compatible with Google App Engine's server environment.

Library has support for only a few API calls. If you need to use a call that's not yet implemented, adding it is trivial. Email me for support; or maybe I can even add it for you.
